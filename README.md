# README

This is my project to get some temperature humidity sensors setup at home.

I was inspired by the LWN article on ESPHome and by [the blog of Chris](https://blog.christophersmart.com/2020/03/31/defining-home-automation-devices-in-yaml-with-esphome-and-home-assistant-no-programming-required/)

The shell script creates a python virtual environment to work in, the rest is standard ESPHome stuff.
